- `start`: Development server with live reload + incremental rebuild. Alias for `dev`.
- `test`: Simply run all tests once.
- `test.watch`: Run tests in watch mode.
- `serve`: Serves the build output. Uses stencil's dev server.
- `serve.prod`: Serves the build output with some production-level stuff like compression enabled. Uses `koa` under the hood.
